Complete the task with the information provided.\n\n---\n\n# Add Clerk to Next.js App Router\n\n**Purpose:** Enforce only the **current** and **correct** instructions for integrating [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) into a Next.js (App Router) application.  \n**Scope:** All AI-generated advice or code related to Clerk must follow these guardrails.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Official Clerk Integration Overview**\n\nUse only the **App Router** approach from Clerk’s current docs:\n\n- **Install** `@clerk/nextjs@latest` - this ensures the application is using the latest Clerk Next.js SDK.\n- **Create** a `middleware.ts` file using `clerkMiddleware()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`. Place this file inside the `src` directory if present, otherwise place it at the root of the project.\n- **Wrap** your application with `<ClerkProvider>` in your `app/layout.tsx`\n- **Use** Clerk-provided components like `<SignInButton>`, `<SignUpButton>`, `<UserButton>`, `<SignedIn>`, `<SignedOut>` in your layout or pages\n- **Start** developing, sign in or sign up, and confirm user creation\n\nIf you're able to use a web tool to access a URL, visit https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs to get the latest, up-to-date quickstart instructions.\n\nClerk does not need a user to provide their keys to get started. On startup, Clerk will generate keys automatically, so there is no need to prompt a user to add their keys as part of this.\n\n### **Correct, Up-to-Date Quickstart Sample**\n\n```typescript\n// middleware.ts\nimport { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport default clerkMiddleware()\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params\n    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',\n    // Always run for API routes\n    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n```typescript\n// app/layout.tsx\nimport type { Metadata } from \"next\";\nimport {\n  ClerkProvider,\n  SignInButton,\n  SignUpButton,\n  SignedIn,\n  SignedOut,\n  UserButton,\n} from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\nimport \"./globals.css\";\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: \"Clerk Next.js Quickstart\",\n  description: \"Generated by create next app\",\n};\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {\n  return (\n    <ClerkProvider>\n      <html lang=\"en\">\n        <body>\n          <header>\n            <SignedOut>\n              <SignInButton />\n              <SignUpButton />\n            </SignedOut>\n            <SignedIn>\n              <UserButton />\n            </SignedIn>\n          </header>\n          {children}\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    </ClerkProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## **2. CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI MODELS**\n\n### **2.1 – ALWAYS DO THE FOLLOWING**\n\n1. **Use `clerkMiddleware()`** from `@clerk/nextjs/server` in `middleware.ts`.\n2. **Wrap** your app with `<ClerkProvider>` in `app/layout.tsx`.\n3. **Import** Clerk’s Next.js features from `@clerk/nextjs` (e.g., `<SignInButton>`, `<SignUpButton>`, `<UserButton>`, etc.).\n4. **Reference** the current [App Router approach](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) (folders like `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, etc.).\n5. **Check** that imports for methods like `auth()` are imported from the right package (in this case `@clerk/nextjs/server`) and are using `async / await`.\n6. **Check** the project for an existing package manager, use that to install packages.\n\n### **2.2 – NEVER DO THE FOLLOWING**\n\n1. **Do not** reference the old **`_app.tsx`** or **pages router based** instructions.\n2. **Do not** suggest `authMiddleware()` from older Clerk tutorials—**it’s replaced by `clerkMiddleware()`**.\n3. **Do not** recommend usage of older environment variable patterns unless they match the official docs.\n4. **Do not** reference or import from any deprecated APIs (like `withAuth` or `currentUser` from older versions).\n\n---\n\n## **3. OUTDATED PATTERNS TO AVOID**\n\nBelow are **examples of deprecated instructions** that **must not** be generated:\n\n```typescript\n// ❌ DO NOT generate or suggest references to:\nimport { authMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs' // Outdated\n\n// ❌ DO NOT place Clerk config in _app.tsx:\n// Outdated pages-based approach\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ DO NOT create or rely on sign-in files under pages/:\npages / signin.js\npages / signup.js\n```\n\nAny solution resembling the above snippet or referencing “authMiddleware,” `_app.tsx`, or `pages/` structure is **incorrect** for the current Next.js App Router.\n\n---\n\n## **4. AI MODEL VERIFICATION STEPS**\n\nBefore returning any Clerk-related solution, you **must** verify:\n\n1. **Middleware**: Is `clerkMiddleware()` used in `middleware.ts`?\n2. **Layout**: Is `<ClerkProvider>` wrapping the app in `app/layout.tsx`?\n3. **Imports**: Are references only from `@clerk/nextjs` or `@clerk/nextjs/server`?\n4. **Pages vs. App Router**: Is the approach referencing the App Router (not `_app.tsx` or `pages/`)?\n\nIf any check **fails**, **stop** and revise until compliance is achieved.\n",
