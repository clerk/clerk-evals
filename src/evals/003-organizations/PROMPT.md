Create a Next.js app with Clerk authentication. The application should sync the Clerk Organization slug with the URL.

For example, a B2B application named "Petstore" has two customer organizations: Acmecorp and Widgetco. Each organization uses its name as a slug in the URL:

Acmecorp: https://petstore.example.com/orgs/acmecorp/dashboard
Widgetco: https://petstore.example.com/orgs/widgetco/dashboard
