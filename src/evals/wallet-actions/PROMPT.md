# Task

Implement wallet actions (signing and sending transactions) in a React application using Openfort.

## Requirements

Create a React app that demonstrates common wallet operations:

1. Set up Openfort with proper wallet configuration
2. Demonstrate transaction signing:
   - Sign messages
   - Sign typed data
3. Demonstrate sending transactions:
   - Send native tokens (ETH, etc.)
   - Interact with smart contracts
4. Use Wagmi hooks for wallet operations (`useWalletClient`, `useAccount`, `useSendTransaction`, `useSignMessage`)
5. Show proper transaction status handling
6. Include error handling for failed transactions
