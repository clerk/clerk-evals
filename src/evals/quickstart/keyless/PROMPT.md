# Task

Explain how to set up Clerk in a new Next.js App Router project using keyless mode, where the user wants to try Clerk without creating an account first.

Include:
1. The necessary installation steps
2. Middleware setup with `clerkMiddleware()`
3. `ClerkProvider` configuration in the app layout
4. What happens automatically when running the development server without API keys configured

Emphasize that no `.env` configuration is needed for the initial setup, and explain how the user can later claim their application and transition to production.
